#WordCombinationBot

This bot finds tweets with any hashtag specified, like "#georgiatech", "#science", or "#games" and creates tweets that contain a combined word from random words within the tweet itself. After retweeting, the bot posts the combined word with its definition, which is made from a random sentence structure and word bank of nouns, verbs, and adjectives and also mentions the user who has either retweeted the post or made the post. Bot posts happen once an hour. In addition, it also automatically replies to tweets that mention this bot with a word made from the post and thanks the user.
